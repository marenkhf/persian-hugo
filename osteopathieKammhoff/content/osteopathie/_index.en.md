## Pediatric Osteopathy
<br>

Pediatric osteopathy is a special form of osteopathy that focuses on the treatment of infants, (small) children, and adolescents. It views the body as a unit and recognizes the interconnections between structure and function. Through gentle, manual techniques, tension and blockages in the body are relieved to promote children's natural health and well-being. This holistic approach supports physical and psychological development. Pediatric osteopathy can be applied to various conditions.
