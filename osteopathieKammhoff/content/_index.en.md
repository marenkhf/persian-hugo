> ### "Humans possess self-regulating mechanisms and the natural ability to self-heal."
>Basic principle of osteopathy  
<br>  

  
Osteopathy represents an independent form of primary medical care.

Diagnosis and treatment are primarily conducted manually, through the hands.  
Detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the human body is combined with clinical examination methods to assess the mobility of the musculoskeletal system and organs. In addition to the element of touch, conversation and interpersonal contact play an important role.

Osteopathic treatment addresses the causes of complaints and incorporates various factors, both physical and non-physical. The focus on individual health, in the sense of salutogenesis, plays an important role.

The holistic treatment concept of osteopathy comprises three areas that together flow into an osteopathic treatment:  
<br>
<br>
 
## *The Three Pillars of Osteopathy*  
<br>
<br>

### Parietal Osteopathy  
  
> Functional diagnosis and treatment of the musculoskeletal system are at the forefront. Key elements include joints, tendons, ligaments, as well as muscles and fascia.

<br>


### Visceral Osteopathy  
  
>The examination and treatment focus on our internal organs and their surrounding structures, nerves, and the vessels leading to and from them, such as the lymphatic and blood vessel systems.

<br>


### Cranial Osteopathy  
  
> Cranial osteopathic treatment focuses on the fine alignment and function of the cranial bones on one hand and the sacrum on the other.  
The skull and sacrum are connected through the membranes of the brain and spinal cord as well as the cerebrospinal fluid, and are considered a functional unit. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## *Pediatric Osteopathy* 
<br>


Pediatric osteopathy is a specialization within osteopathy. Knowledge of the normal sensory, emotional, and neurological development of the child plays an important role. Common indications for osteopathic treatment include:

* Pregnancy and birth complications
* Growth disorders and developmental delays
* Digestive complaints (colic) and urogenital complaints (incontinence) 
* Cranial asymmetries and jaw misalignments
* Sleep disorders and sucking difficulties
