### Stuttgart location
<br>

The practice is located at Kelterstra√üe 50 in 70199 Stuttgart, Heslach. A bus stop can be reached on foot in 5 minutes. There are parking spaces in the surrounding streets, which are subject to a charge.
The cozy practice is located in a building on a hillside and is not barrier-free. Outside there are some steps that lead to the building. Families with strollers can leave the stroller in the designated "parking space" in front of the first staircase. 


### Berlin location
<br>

After many years of practicing in Berlin, I continue to be in the practice at Schumannstrasse 17, 10117 Berlin once a month and treat my old and new patients of all ages.
