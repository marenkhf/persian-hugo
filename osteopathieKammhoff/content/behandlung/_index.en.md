### Process
<br>

The initial treatment focuses on a thorough discussion and a comprehensive examination to make an osteopathic diagnosis. This is followed by an individualized treatment.
The follow-up treatment consists of an osteopathic examination and treatment.

Payment can be made directly by VISA or MasterCard or by invoice. Unfortunately, cash payments are not accepted.
Appointments must be canceled 24 hours in advance; otherwise, the full treatment cost will be charged.

Exceptions are infectious diseases. If you have symptoms of upper respiratory infections, fever, or body aches, please refrain from attending the treatment appointment out of consideration for the risk of infection.

### Insurance Coverage
<br>

Most statutory health insurance providers cover part of the treatment costs if the osteopath meets specific educational requirements. This is the case for me, due to my full-time studies in osteopathy. However, there are exceptions such as AOK Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and LKK, which only cover osteopathic treatment if the therapist is also a physiotherapist or a doctor, which does not apply to me. Barmer also only subsidizes osteopathy under the Family Plus Package and the Bonus Program. **[Here](https://www.krankenkassen.de/gesetzliche-krankenkassen/leistungen-gesetzliche-krankenkassen/alternative-heilmethoden/osteopathie)** you can find a list of insurance providers that support osteopathic treatments. A referral (private prescription) from your attending physician's office must be brought on the day of the first treatment.

Private health insurance providers often cover osteopathic treatment costs as part of an allowance for alternative practitioners. In this case, billing is based on the fee schedule for alternative practitioners. Depending on the services provided, costs can vary by up to 5 Euros.
