### Cost Coverage  
Public health insurance covers part of the treatment costs. **[Here](https://www.krankenkassen.de/gesetzliche-krankenkassen/leistungen-gesetzliche-krankenkassen/alternative-heilmethoden/osteopathie)** you can find a list of health insurance companies that support osteopathic treatments. The referral from the doctorâ€™s office must be brought on the day of the first treatment.

Private health insurance often covers the costs of osteopathic treatment as part of a lump sum for alternative practitioners. In this case, billing is done according to the fee schedule for alternative practitioners.
  
Inquire with your health insurance company or contact **[me](https://www.osteopathiekammhoff.de/kontakt/ "Contact")** if you have any questions.
